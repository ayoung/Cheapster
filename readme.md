# Cheapster iOS app

This is an iOS app written in C# using [Xamarin.iOS](http://xamarin.com/ios), formerly known as MonoTouch. You can find the app on the iOS App Store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cheapster/id426078800?mt=8) This project has not been in active development for at least 3 years since the writing of this readme. If you wish to make changes, improvements, and/or updates to the app they are heartily welcome. I only ask that you make a proposal to what you wish to do in a GitHub issue.

Before this app can be republshed, it would need to be updated for iOS 7.
